	abstract = {We present a computational model for the mammalian circadian clock based on the intertwined positive and negative regulatory loops involving the Per, Cry, Bmal1, Clock, and Rev-Erb α genes. In agreement with experimental observations, the model can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in continuous darkness, characterized by an antiphase relationship between Per/Cry/Rev-Erbα and Bmal1 mRNAs. Sustained oscillations correspond to the rhythms autonomously generated by suprachiasmatic nuclei. For other parameter values, damped oscillations can also be obtained in the model. These oscillations, which transform into sustained oscillations when coupled to a periodic signal, correspond to rhythms produced by peripheral tissues. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark cycles. Simulations show that the phase of the oscillations can then vary by several hours with relatively minor changes in parameter values. Such a lability of the phase could account for physiological disorders related to circadian rhythms in humans, such as advanced or delayed sleep phase syndrome, whereas the lack of entrainment by light-dark cycles can be related to the non-24h sleep-wake syndrome. The model uncovers the possible existence of multiple sources of oscillatory behavior. Thus, in conditions where the indirect negative autoregulation of Per and Cry expression is inoperative, the model indicates the possibility that sustained oscillations might still arise from the negative autoregulation of Bmal1 expression.},

    abstract = {Summary
    Activation of ErbB receptors by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or heregulin (HRG) determines distinct cell-fate decisions, although signals propagate through shared pathways. Using mathematical modeling and experimental approaches, we unravel how HRG and EGF generate distinct, all-or-none responses of the phosphorylated transcription factor c-Fos. In the cytosol, EGF induces transient and HRG induces sustained ERK activation. In the nucleus, however, ERK activity and c-fos mRNA expression are transient for both ligands. Knockdown of dual-specificity phosphatases extends HRG-stimulated nuclear ERK activation, but not c-fos mRNA expression, implying the existence of a HRG-induced repressor of c-fos transcription. Further experiments confirmed that this repressor is mainly induced by HRG, but not EGF, and requires new protein synthesis. We show how a spatially distributed, signaling-transcription cascade robustly discriminates between transient and sustained ERK activities at the c-Fos system level. The proposed control mechanisms are general and operate in different cell types, stimulated by various ligands.}

    abstract = {Summary
    One of the unique characteristics of cellular signaling pathways is that a common signaling pathway can selectively regulate multiple cellular functions of a hormone; however, this selective downstream control through a common signaling pathway is poorly understood. Here we show that the insulin-dependent AKT pathway uses temporal patterns multiplexing for selective regulation of downstream molecules. Pulse and sustained insulin stimulations were simultaneously encoded into transient and sustained AKT phosphorylation, respectively. The downstream molecules, including ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) selectively decoded transient, sustained, and both transient and sustained AKT phosphorylation, respectively. Selective downstream decoding is mediated by the molecules' network structures and kinetics. Our results demonstrate that the AKT pathway can multiplex distinct patterns of blood insulin, such as pulse-like additional and sustained-like basal secretions, and the downstream molecules selectively decode secretion patterns of insulin.}

    abstract = {Functional organization of signal transduction into protein phosphorylation cascades, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, greatly enhances the sensitivity of cellular targets to external stimuli. The sensitivity increases multiplicatively with the number of cascade levels, so that a tiny change in a stimulus results in a large change in the response, the phenomenon referred to as ultrasensitivity. In a variety of cell types, the MAPK cascades are imbedded in long feedback loops, positive or negative, depending on whether the terminal kinase stimulates or inhibits the activation of the initial level. Here we demonstrate that a negative feedback loop combined with intrinsic ultrasensitivity of the MAPK cascade can bring about sustained oscillations in MAPK phosphorylation. Based on recent kinetic data on the MAPK cascades, we predict that the period of oscillations can range from minutes to hours. The phosphorylation level can vary between the base level and almost 100\% of the total protein. The oscillations of the phosphorylation cascades and slow protein diffusion in the cytoplasm can lead to intracellular waves of phospho-proteins.},

    abstract = {Summary
    Upon stimulation of cells with transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), Smad proteins form trimeric complexes and activate a broad spectrum of target genes. It remains unresolved which of the possible Smad complexes are formed in cellular contexts and how these contribute to gene expression. By combining quantitative mass spectrometry with a computational selection strategy, we predict and provide experimental evidence for the three most relevant Smad complexes in the mouse hepatoma cell line Hepa1-6. Utilizing dynamic pathway modeling, we specify the contribution of each Smad complex to the expression of representative Smad target genes, and show that these contributions are conserved in human hepatoma cell lines and primary hepatocytes. We predict, based on gene expression data of patient samples, increased amounts of Smad2/3/4 proteins and Smad2 phosphorylation as hallmarks of hepatocellular carcinoma and experimentally verify this prediction. Our findings demonstrate that modeling approaches can disentangle the complexity of transcription factor complex formation and its impact on gene expression.}

    ABSTRACT = {A current challenge in systems biology is to predict dynamic properties of cell behaviors from public information such as gene expression data. The temporal dynamics of signaling molecules is critical for mammalian cell commitment. We hypothesized that gene expression levels are tightly linked with and quantitatively control the dynamics of signaling networks regardless of the cell type. Based on this idea, we developed a computational method to predict the signaling dynamics from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) gene expression data. We first constructed an ordinary differential equation model of ErbB receptor &rarr; c-Fos induction using a newly developed modeling platform BioMASS. The model was trained with kinetic parameters against multiple breast cancer cell lines using autologous RNA-seq data obtained from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) as the initial values of the model components. After parameter optimization, the model proceeded to prediction in another untrained breast cancer cell line. As a result, the model learned the parameters from other cells and was able to accurately predict the dynamics of the untrained cells using only the gene expression data. Our study suggests that gene expression levels of components within the ErbB network, rather than rate constants, can explain the cell-specific signaling dynamics, therefore playing an important role in regulating cell fate.},
