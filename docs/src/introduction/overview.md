# BioMASS overview
In this section, we will familiarize ourselves with the structure and functionality of BioMASS.
We will use a model available in the BioMASS repository.

Open yor file browser and navigate to the models directory in the BioMASS repository. 
Go to:
biomass -> biomass -> models 

Three models are available in the models directory, each stored in its own directory. 
Each of these model directories contains all files necessary to define a model in BioMASS.

We will use the model of a MAPK cascade in this overview.

Open the mapk_cascade directory.

The file 'set_model.py' contains the structure of the model implemented as ODEs, as well as the definitions of all parameters and initial values.
